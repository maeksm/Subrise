SUBRISE WORDPRESS THEME

This is my first semi serious wordpress theme. I only put it on github so that I can easily access it. 

v0.0.2
+   Frontpage has four footer widget areas
+   Two simple widgets are created, RSS and Facebook. Might make the facebook widget more interesting
-   Adjusted the twitter widget, might take it over and use adjust it more too my liking
-   Still need to create highlight widget.. Shouldn't be too difficult
-   Blog layout still sucks.. might change some colors later on the day.. will change it more to my own style 
    in the future ofcourse..
